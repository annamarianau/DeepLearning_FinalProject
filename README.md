# GAN_mammogram_classification

### Problem definition:
Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer for women according to Shi et al., 2019 or National Cancer Insitute, 2020. Therefore, the detection of breast cancer at an early stage using mammography images is imperative to reduce the number of fatal cases. Deep learning architectures have shown to be a valuable method in classifying malignant and benign breast cancer cases.Most datasets of mammography images are small and thus provide a problem in training deep learning networks. 

### Motivation and plan:
To improve the performance of existing mammogram classifiers (e.g., ResNet and VGGNet) by generating additional images via a generative adversarial network (GAN).

### Dataset:
The mini-MIAS database (http://peipa.essex.ac.uk/info/mias.html) provided by the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS). The dataset contains 322 gray RGB-scale images of size 1024x1024, categorized into the following three groups: 1) normal breast tissue (n=207), 2) benign, non-cancerous breast tissue (n=63), and 3) malignant, cancerous breast tissue (n=52).
